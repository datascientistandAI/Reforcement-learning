# Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) using TensorFlow, focusing on building models that can learn optimal policies through interaction with an environment. The notebook provides theoretical insights, practical implementations, and exercises to enhance understanding of various RL algorithms, particularly in the context of games like Atari Breakout.

## What I've Learned

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals**: Gained insights into the key concepts of reinforcement learning, including agents, environments, states, actions, and rewards.
- **Double Dueling DQN**: Implemented a Double Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) to achieve superhuman performance in the Atari Breakout game.
- **Image Processing for RL**: Explored techniques for processing images as observations in the environment, including downsampling and converting to grayscale.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- Python version ≥ 3.7
- TensorFlow version ≥ 2.8
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - OpenAI Gym (for Atari environments)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow gym[atari]
```

### Running the Notebook

To execute the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository containing the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to set up the environment, implement the DQN, and visualize results.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Setup

The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries and checking for GPU availability:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))  # Check for GPU availability
```

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

An exercise is provided to implement a **Double Dueling DQN** for training an agent to play Atari Breakout:

- **Observations**: Convert images to grayscale, crop, and downsample.
- **State Representation**: Merge consecutive frames to provide context.

### 3. TensorFlow Environment Configuration

Ensure that the required Python version and TensorFlow version are correct:

```python
import sys
assert sys.version_info >= (3, 7)

from packaging import version
import tensorflow as tf
assert version.parse(tf.__version__) >= version.parse("2.8.0")
```

### 4. Data Visualization

Setting up visualization configurations for plotting results and animations:

```python
import matplotlib.animation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.rc('font', size=14)
plt.rc('axes', labelsize=14, titlesize=14)
plt.rc('legend', fontsize=14)
plt.rc('xtick', labelsize=10)
plt.rc('ytick', labelsize=10)
plt.rc('animation', html='jshtml')
```

### 5. Additional Exercises

The notebook encourages experimentation with robotics using Raspberry Pi, suggesting practical projects like:

- Creating a robot that can detect and move towards light.
- Implementing object detection algorithms using cameras and reinforcement learning.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an educational resource for anyone interested in reinforcement learning and deep learning. By exploring the concepts of Double Dueling DQNs and practical applications in games and robotics, users gain a deeper understanding of how agents learn to make decisions through interaction with their environment.
